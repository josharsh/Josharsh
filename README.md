> I like building small things that work and big things that scale. Sometimes they're the same thing.
> I am an engineer and currently building applied AI systems, developer tools, and blocks that would power tomorrow's AI infrastructure.
> Mostly focused on making agentic systems reliable for production.
> Currently at [Visa](https://visa.com), building payment systems at scale, previously a founding engineer at [Plum](https://plumhq.com)

### Thinking about
Testing non-deterministic AI systems. Better abstractions for agentic workflows.
